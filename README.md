# SQL-Project
A project with the intent of running a database for a computer hardware company.

I unfortunately no longer have Visual Basic for Applications so I'm unable to provide the full databases.
ALSO:
    <h2>I unforunately have to merge both SQL and VB files as I pulled these from my presentation file.
    The presentaion file that I pulled my old files from is not an accurate representaion of how my
    coding was properly made and structured.</h2>
